### What is a Table?

A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a single field.

### What is a View?

A view is a virtual table that is based on the results of a query. A view is not stored in the database, but is created dynamically when the view is referenced.

### Why Use Tables and Views?

Tables and views are used to store and retrieve data. They are the primary way to store and retrieve data in SQL Server.

### What is a Primary Key?

A primary key is a unique identifier for a row in a table. It is used to uniquely identify a row in a table.

### What is a Foreign Key?

A foreign key is a field in a table that is a primary key in another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables.

### What is a One-to-Many Relationship?

A one-to-many relationship is a relationship between two tables where one row in the first table can be related to many rows in the second table.

### What is a Many-to-Many Relationship?

A many-to-many relationship is a relationship between two tables where many rows in the first table can be related to many rows in the second table.

### What is a Composite Key?

A composite key is a primary key that is made up of more than one field.

### What is a Clustered Index?

A clustered index is an index that is physically stored in the same order as the data in the table.

### What is a Nonclustered Index?

A nonclustered index is an index that is physically stored in a different order than the data in the table.

### What is a Unique Index?

A unique index is an index that ensures that all values in a column are unique.

### What is a Nonunique Index?

A nonunique index is an index that allows duplicate values in a column.

### What is a Bitmap Index?

A bitmap index is an index that is used to quickly find rows that match a specific value.

### What is a Columnstore Index?

A columnstore index is an index that is used to quickly find rows that match a specific value.

### What is a Full-Text Index?

A full-text index is an index that is used to quickly find rows that match a specific value.

### What is a Spatial Index?

A spatial index is an index that is used to quickly find rows that match a specific value.

### What is a Table Partition?

A table partition is a subset of a table that is stored in a separate file.

### What is a Table Partition Function?

A table partition function is a function that determines which partition a row should be stored in.

### What is a Table Partition Scheme?

A table partition scheme is a scheme that determines how the partitions are stored.

### What is a Table Partition Boundary?

A table partition boundary is a value that determines which partition a row should be stored in.

### What is a Table Partition Map?

A table partition map is a map that determines which partition a row should be stored in.

### What is a Table Partition Column?

A table partition column is a column that determines which partition a row should be stored in.

### What is a Table Partition Expression?

A table partition expression is an expression that determines which partition a row should be stored in.

### What is a Table Partition Template?

A table partition template is a template that determines which partition a row should be stored in.
