# Designing and Implementing SQL Server Tables and Views

Introduction to SQL Server Tables and Views.

## Introducing Tables and Views

Some definitions can be found [here](definitions.md) :-).

Relational databases are made up of tables and views. Tables are used to store data. Views are used to retrieve data. Views are also used to restrict access to data. Views can be used to hide sensitive data from users. Views can also be used to combine data from multiple tables. Tables are related to each other through relationships.

E.F. Codd, the father of relational databases. He is credited with inventing the relational database model.

Some terminology:

- relation == table,
- tuple == row,
- attribute == column,
- RDBMS == relational database management system.

Problem description (for which we will create a database):

**Bob's Shoes**

Bob has a factory that produces shoes, he needs a database to store information about his shoes, customers, orders, etc.

We need to store:

- customer information,
- order information,
- shoe information.
