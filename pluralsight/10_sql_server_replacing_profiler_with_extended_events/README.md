# SQL Server: Replacing Profiler with Extended Events

Introduction to using Extended Events instead of Profiler.

## 1. Introduction

SQL Trace was introduced in SQL Server 6.5 as a graphical tool.

SQL Profiler was introduced in SQL Server 7.0.

### SQL Trace/Profiler, Example Uses, and Why it's Time to Move On

Basic uses of trace:

- providing real-time insight into SQL Server activity,
- capturing of queries and their resource usage,
- auditing of user activity,
- capture a baseline or replaying a workload,
- most frequently used for troubleshooting performance issues and errors.

Why do we have to stop using Trace and Profiler?

### Comparing Functionality and Why We Avoid Extended Events

| Trace/Profiler                     | Extended Events                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Capture query information          | Capture query information                           |
| Choose which fields to capture     | Choose which fields to capture                      |
| Filter on different fields         | Filter on different fields                          |
| Multiple options for data analysis | Multiple options for data analysis                  |
| -                                  | Provide multiple options for data collction         |
| -                                  | Flexible in implementation and configuration        |
| -                                  | Only method for tracing **new** SQL Server features |

Why do we avoid extended events?

- one reason: **change**.

### Extended Events and Example Uses

Advanced event collection infrastructure introduced in SQL Server 2008 and provided by SQLOS.

Highly-flexible implementation which allows complex configurations for event collection that simplify problem identification.

What is Extended Events, really?

- it's a _general event-handling system for server systems_,
- _the Extended Events infrastructure supports the correlation of data from SQL Server_,
- an infrastructure which provides the ability to create complex sessions to collect event information.

Examples of troubleshooting options available in Extended Events:

- identifying stored procedures that exceed a prior maximum,
- capturing first N executions of an event,
- finding accumulated effect of queries using query_hash,
- identifying statement timeouts/attention events.
