# SQL Server: Replacing Profiler with Extended Events

Introduction to using Extended Events instead of Profiler.

## 1. Introduction

SQL Trace was introduced in SQL Server 6.5 as a graphical tool.

SQL Profiler was introduced in SQL Server 7.0.

### SQL Trace/Profiler, Example Uses, and Why it's Time to Move On

Basic uses of trace:

- providing real-time insight into SQL Server activity,
- capturing of queries and their resource usage,
- auditing of user activity,
- capture a baseline or replaying a workload,
- most frequently used for troubleshooting performance issues and errors.

Why do we have to stop using Trace and Profiler?

### Comparing Functionality and Why We Avoid Extended Events

| Trace/Profiler                     | Extended Events                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Capture query information          | Capture query information                           |
| Choose which fields to capture     | Choose which fields to capture                      |
| Filter on different fields         | Filter on different fields                          |
| Multiple options for data analysis | Multiple options for data analysis                  |
| -                                  | Provide multiple options for data collection        |
| -                                  | Flexible in implementation and configuration        |
| -                                  | Only method for tracing **new** SQL Server features |

Why do we avoid extended events?

- one reason: **change**.

### Extended Events and Example Uses

Advanced event collection infrastructure introduced in SQL Server 2008 and provided by SQLOS.

Highly-flexible implementation which allows complex configurations for event collection that simplify problem identification.

What is Extended Events, really?

- it's a _general event-handling system for server systems_,
- _the Extended Events infrastructure supports the correlation of data from SQL Server_,
- an infrastructure which provides the ability to create complex sessions to collect event information.

Examples of troubleshooting options available in Extended Events:

- identifying stored procedures that exceed a prior maximum,
- capturing first N executions of an event,
- finding accumulated effect of queries using query_hash,
- identifying statement timeouts/attention events.

## 2. Transitioning from Profilerâ€™s UI to Extended Events

### Introduction, the Extended Events Engine, and its Objects

Extended Events Engine:

- Database Engine -> SQLOS -> Extended Events Engine -> Packages

> The Extended Events Engine is a collection of services and objects that it manages and is an interaction point for other SQL Server processes.

### Making the Leap from Profiler Trace to Extended Events

We need to understand some terminology to start with Extended Events.

### Events and Event Comparison

> An event corresponds to a well-known point in the code.

Events (some examples):

- Data File Auto Grow,
- Sort Warning,
- Object: Created,
- SP: StmtCompleted,
- Lock: Acquired,
- SQL: StmtRecompile,
- Deadlock Graph.

Event comparison:

| Trace               | Extended Events              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| SP: StmtCompleted   | sp_statement_completed       |
| SQL: StmtRecompile  | sp_statement_recompile       |
| Data File Auto Grow | database_file_size_changed\* |
| Deadlock Graph      | xml_deadlock_report          |
| Audit Login         | ~~login~~                    |

### Event Changes by Version and Considerations for Events

The number of XE events increased greatly over time (from 253 in MSSQL 2008 to 1303 in MSSQL 2016).

> Events have a default payload - a set of data elements that are always returned by an event and cannot be altered\*.

### Predicates and Considerations for Predicates

Predicates:

- a predicate is a filter,
- predicates support short-circuit evaluation,
- predicates can operate on event payload data or global predicate source.

> If you filter on an element that is not part of the default payload, the Engine has to first collect that information before it can perform predicate evaluation.

### Actions and Considerations for Actions

Actions:

- an action is an additional operation performed when the event fires:
  - _collect_ the database ID,
  - _collect_ the session ID,
  - _create_ a mini dump for the current thread,
- an action executes _only_ when the event fires, therefore the predicate must evaluate to true first.

> Think carefully about what actions are really necessary and relevant. Some actions have serious side effects. Other actions can have high overhead based on the event and how frequently it fires.

### Targets and Considerations for Targets

Targets:

- targets consume the events and they store the data in either raw or aggregated format,
- different targets:
  - event file,
  - ring buffer,
  - event counter,
  - histogram,
  - event pairing,
  - event tracing for Windows.

> Only the event file target stores data permanently. All other targets are memory-resident and only store data while the event session is running.

### The Big Picture

1. Event encountered if IsEnabled = True, continue in collection mode.
2. Collect payload data.
3. Perform predicate evaluation.
4. If true, event fires (publish).
5. Execute actions to collect additional data.
6. Serve data to synchronous targets.
7. Buffer event data to memory buffers (specific to event session).
8. Dispatch event data to target (buffers filled or dispatch latency reached).

### Event Session Options

General options:

- `STARTUP_STATE` - starts the event session automatically,
- `TRACK_CAUSALITY` - attaches GUID and sequence number to events.

Advanced options:

- `EVENT_RETENTION_MODE` - determines the level of event loss,
- `MAX_DISPATCH_LATENCY` - affects how quickly events get to the target,
- `MAX_MEMORY` - not the actual maximum memory for the event session,
- `MEMORY_PARTITION_MODE` - determines the number of memory buffers for the event session,
- `MAX_EVENT_SIZE` - based on event definitions.

## 3. Leveraging the Extended Events UI

Everything we used to do with T-SQL, you can now do in the UI (and more!).

### New Session Wizard, New Session, and Templates

New Session Wizard allows quick creation of a new session from a template or with a minimal set of configurable options.

New Session dialog can be used for advanced session creation with all available options and targets.

Existing sessions can be modified through the right-click menu option.

Templates:

- templates are an easy way to automate setup of an Extended Events session,
- you can export an existing session to create a template,
- you can create a custom category for templates you create by editing the XML file.

### Event Session Creation and Output Analysis in the UI

Showed during demo.

### Live Data Viewer, Customize Columns, Grouping and Aggregation

Live Data Viewer reads a live stream of event buffers from and Extended Events session on a server.

Within the data viewer you can customize what columns you see and you can create merged columns.

Within the UI data can be grouped by any of the available columns.

Data can also be aggregated to display, for example, the minimum, maximum, or average value fo a column.

Expand grouping to see data at a detail level.

### Expanding a Grouping and Filtering

Data can be filtered based on time and/or column values.

### Merging Files, Bookmarking Events

Multiple files can be merged together in the UI to create one master file for analysis.

Events can be bookmarked within the UI, making it easy to quickly find them again.

## 4. Understanding Target Options for Extended Events

### Introduction and Target Basics

Targets are event consumers.

Receive either a single event or a buffer full of events.

Target type:

- basic,
- aggregate.

Target timing:

- synchronous,
- asynchronous.

### Event Dispatching and Revisiting the Big Picture

Event dispatching:

- memory buffer becomes full,
- event data in the buffer exceeds the event session's `MAX_DISPATCH_LATENCY` configuration option.

### Event File, Event Counter, and Histogram Targets

Event file target:

- event data is saved to a file on disk,
- the file can be read in the UI in SQL Server 2012+.

Event counter target:

- counts the number of events that fired,
- useful when initially setting up an event session or troubleshooting an unknown workload,
- synchronous target that processes on the thread that fires the event.

Histogram target:

- collects event into "buckets" to provide additional analysis within event frequency,
- you can only "bucket" on one field,
- buckets (slots) should be specified with enough room to accommodate all potential values.

### Tracking Database File Growth Using the Histogram Target

Showed during demo.

### Event Pairing and Ring Buffer Targets

Event pairing target:

- captures only unmatched events,
- it is essential to select the proper criteria for matching, otherwise your data will not be valid:
- use `TRACK_CAUSALITY` and the event_file or ring_buffer target to troubleshoot.

### Using the Ring Buffer Target

Ring buffer target:

- in-memory target that does FIFO collection,
- data is materialized as XML when it's queried via `sys.dm_xe_session_targets`:
  - DMV limitations may result in unreadable XML.

Showed during demo.

## 5. Avoiding Performance Issues with Extended Events

The most important items to think about as they relate to performance when creating an event session.

Performance must still be considered with Extended Events.

### Introduction and General Performance Considerations

Considerations:

- specific events are **still** expensive,
- write your predicates carefully,
- adding actions adds overhead,
- even with a lot of memory on a server, you need to set limits.

Expensive events:

- query_post_compilation_showplan,
- query_pre_execution_showplan,
- query_post_execution_showplan.

### Create Good Predicates

> If you filter on an element that is not a part of the default payload, the Engine has to first collect that information **before** it can perform predicate evaluation.

The first false evaluation of a logical block in a predicate prevents further evaluation.

### Code Examples of Good and Bad Predicates

Showed during demo.

### Action Overhead and Limit Setting

Overhead with actions:

- actions execute synchronously on the firing thread,
- actions can cause side effects to occur when an event fires,
- large actions (e.g. sql_text, sql_context) may require additional consideration for event sizing.

Set limits!

### Ignoring the Warnings

Showed during demo.

### Extended Events Pros and Cons

What you're going to grumble about:

- you cannot integrate PerfMon data with Extended Events data,
- with the histogram target you can only bucket on one field at a time,
- Distributed Replay requires \*.trc files,
- it's just not the same as Trace/SQL Profiler.

Favorite things about XE:

- you can create multiple sessions and start and stop them as needed,
- you have search capability in the list of events,
- track causality,
- write to multiple targets,
- you can now work with data in the UI.

## Summary

Extended Events is a powerful tool for troubleshooting and performance monitoring. Now you know how to replace SQL Profiler with Extended Events and how to use the UI to analyze your data.
