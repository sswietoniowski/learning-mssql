*** Working with the T-SQL Data Manipulation Language ***
Instructions and snippets to follow along the WHERE demo, are included below.

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the database server where you restored or created the database.

2. Click on *tsql-dml* within the Object Explorer and click on New Query.

3. Make sure that it is the currently selected database in the dropdown at the top.

4. Execute the following query to get all the Posts without any filter:
	SELECT * FROM Posts

5. Then filter them by their score:
	SELECT * FROM Posts
	WHERE 
		Score > 30

6. We can try a different query. This one shows different WHERE filters available:
	SELECT * FROM Posts
	WHERE 
		/* All Posts with a Score greater than 50 */
		Score > 30 
		/* All Posts that include the word machine-learning anywhere within their Tags */
		AND Tags LIKE '%machine-learning%'
		/* All Posts where creation year is 2014, 2015 or 2018 */
		AND YEAR(CreationDate) IN (2014, 2015, 2018)
		/* All Posts that contain at least one comment */
		AND EXISTS (SELECT Id FROM Comments WHERE PostId = Posts.Id)
		/* All Posts with a Favorite Count Between 40 and 100 */
		AND FavoriteCount BETWEEN 40 AND 100
